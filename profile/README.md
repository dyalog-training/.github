# Dyalog Training
The repositories found herein contain supporting materials for training conducted conducted by or on behalf of Dyalog, LTD.

## Repository Naming Scheme
To help you navigate through the repositories, we will attempt to find a consistent naming scheme for each type of training. Time will tell how successful we are. 

### Dyalog User Meeting Workshops
Repositories containing material for Dyalog User Meeting workshops will have names in the format YYYY-DTN where:

* YYYY is the year of the Dyalog User Meeting
* DTN is the workshop designation where:
    * D is the first letter of the day of the workshop.  
    * T is the time of the workshop - either "A" for morning or "P" for afternoon.
    * N is the workshop ordinal number for that time period. 
    
Example: Repository 2022-SP2 contains materials for the second workshop conducted on Sunday afternoon at Dyalog'22.

### Other types of training
As we add materials for other types of training (classes, webcasts, webinars, etc.), we'll think up a clever naming scheme for them as well.
